        <p class="text-primary">As a semester project i would like to do something that deals with web applications.
        By that, i mean using HTML, CSS, PHP, Apache and MySQL to carry out some web applications. Primarily i am interested
        in connecting web pages and data to a server and database and interacting with the server and database. Kind 
        of like a full-stack experience in creating a whole web application. That sounds like a good learning experience 
        to me.</p>
